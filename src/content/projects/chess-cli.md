![Chess game in terminal](@src/assets/projects/chess-cli.png)

This was my final project in the Ruby portion of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://theodinproject.com). It is a chess game played with a command-line interface.

I applied test-driven development as an experiment using RSpec and also many OOP principles. It accounts for many nuances of chess such as the "en passant" rule.
