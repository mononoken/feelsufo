DeepCast is a startup that is building tools for listeners and creators of podcasts.

I worked as a full stack developer at DeepCast. One area I specialized in was our search functionality. We provider search results using both keyword search and semantic search. I also implemented search filtering for both of these search techniques.

We also build tools for podcasters to help build their podcasts and market them. I worked on tools that allow podcasters to customize the content that displays on their podcast's pages.
