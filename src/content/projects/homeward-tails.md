I started contributing to Homeward Tails in January 2024. After working on a few issues, I noticed the authorization throughout the application was inconsistent and even missing in some areas. I volunteered to implement an authorization framework for the entire app to address these issues.

The resulting work took a little over a month and can be found in this PR [Authorization framework with Action Policy #466](https://github.com/rubyforgood/homeward-tails/pull/466).

After working on the app more, I was asked to join the project as a collaborator and member of the lead team to further help the project. I am continuing to work with the Homeward Tails team and having lots of fun doing so!
