Hi! I'm Ken Maeshima. I reside in Seattle, WA.

I currently work at [DeepCast](https://deepcast.fm) building tools for podcasts. If you see a podcast missing in our catalog, you can use the tool I built to check if our backlog has it and request us to queue it up for processing. I've also built many tools for searching through the vast amounts of info we have gathered from podcasts.

I also volunteer with [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org) on [Homeward Tails](https://homewardtails.org). Many pet rescues and shelters struggle while they are doing so much good for our furry friends. Our mission is to help them by providing free tools to get their animals to loving homes. One of my proudest accomplishments was [building the authorization of the app using Action Policy](https://github.com/rubyforgood/pet-rescue/pull/466).

Some offline things I'm currently into are: Exploring Washingtons many trails, tinkering with my [Spintronics](https://upperstory.com/spintronics/) circuits, playing [Dune Imperium](https://www.direwolfdigital.com/dune-imperium/), and meeting people that code (local meetups and confs).

I formerly worked as a licensed structural engineer for <nobr>8 years</nobr> mostly designing components for large steel structures such as schools and hospitals. I also had the pleasure of working on a hotel with a Texas-shaped lazy river, the FC Dallas stadium, and the Charlotte Convention Center. After deciding to pursue a career in software engineering instead, I completed the <nobr>full-stack</nobr> curriculum at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
